A ride sharing business wants to detect predictors for 68% churning rate to improve attrition rate and reduce on-boarding costs of drivers. I identified that most drivers churned in the year 2020 due to decrease in business value, low quarterly rating, or low monthly income. I used XGBoost (87.2% accuracy) and Random Forest (88.8% accuracy) algorithms, where both got a model lift of 1.3.
